# Concepts

`tc` defines, creates and manages serveless entities such as functions, mutations, events, routes, states, queues and channels. tc compiles a tree of entities defined in the filesystem as a topology. This composable, namespaced, sandboxed, recursive, versioned and isomorphic topology is called a `Cloud Functor`.
