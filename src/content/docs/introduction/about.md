`tc` is a graph-based, stateless, serverless application & infrastructure composer.

`tc` defines, creates and manages serveless entities such as functions, mutations, events, routes, states, queues and channels. tc compiles a tree of entities defined in the filesystem as a topology. This composable, namespaced, sandboxed, recursive, versioned and isomorphic topology is called a `Cloud Functor`.

The word functor was popularized by Ocaml's parameterized modules. These modules, called functors, are first class. Cloud functors are similar in that they are treated as first class and are composable much like Ocaml's elegant modules.

:::caution
tc is still quite nascent and is being actively developed. This documentation is work in progress.
