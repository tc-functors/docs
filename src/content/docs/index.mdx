tc (topology composer) provides a higher-level abstraction for serverless development, focusing on the logical relationships between core entities rather than the underlying infrastructure details.

`tc` defines, creates and resolves serveless entities such as functions, mutations, events, routes, states, queues, channels and pages. tc compiles a tree of entities defined in the filesystem as a topology. This composable, namespaced, sandboxed, recursive, versioned and isomorphic topology is called a `Cloud Functor`. A _Cloud Functor_ has six key features:


<div>
  <div>
    <h3>Composable Entities</h3>
    <p>
    Compose the core entities (functions, events, mutations, queues, routes, states, pages and channels) as a Directed Acyclic <u>Graph</u>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Namespacing</h3>
    <p>
    Scope and group your functions, events, routes and other entities similar to <u>modules</u> in a programming language.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Sandboxing</h3>
    <p>
    Sandbox your namespaced topologies with reasonable boundaries similar to <u>packages</u> in a programming language.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Inferred Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>
	Generate infrastructure boilerplate like permissions similar to <u>types</u> in a dynamic programming language.

    </p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Recursive Topology</h3>
    <p>
    Create functors at any level in the code repository's heirarchy like <u>fractals</u>.
    </p>

  </div>
</div>

:::note[Comparison]
tc is a serverless, graph-based application composer that dynamically generates infrastructure boilerplate code. It provides a set of high-level *serverless constructs* to define entities and the connections between them as a graph. It is different from Terraform, SST, Amplify, Cloudformation etc as it focuses primarily on high-level application composition than provider or infrastructure-specific details.
