> “The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.” -  Edsger W. Dijkstra

tc (topology composer) provides a higher-level abstraction for serverless development, focusing on the logical relationships between abstract entities (functions, events, routes, queues, channels, mutations and pages) rather than the underlying infrastructure details. tc is a stateless, graph-based, cloud-agnostic* **application composer**.

tc compiles a tree of entities defined in the filesystem as a topology. This composable, namespaced, sandboxed, recursive, versioned and isomorphic topology is called a `Cloud Functor`. A Cloud Functor has 3 key concepts - Entity Abstraction, Namespacing and Entity Composition. tc implements the Cloud Functor pattern.


Cloud Functor and tc bring the abstractions and joy of functional programming to serverless computing.

:::caution
tc is still quite nascent and is being actively developed. This documentation is work in progress.
:::

tc is primarily a CLI app. There are external modules which provide a [HTMX-based Inspector UI](/extras/inspector/), a [Local Emulator](/extras/emulator/) and a [Lisp Interpreter](/extras/lisp).
The CLI app provides a core set of commands to manage the lifecycle of sandboxed topologies.

```
Usage: tc <COMMAND>

Commands:
  build     Build layers, image trees, extensions and pack function code
  compose   Compose a Topology
  create    Create a sandboxed topology
  delete    Delete a sandboxed topology
  freeze    Freeze a sandbox and make it immutable
  invoke    Invoke a topology synchronously or asynchronously
  prune     Prune all resources in given sandbox
  resolve   Resolve a topology
  snapshot  Snapshot given sandbox
  test      Run tests in topology
  tag       Create semver tags scoped by a topology
  unfreeze  Unfreeze a sandbox and make it mutable
  update    Update entity and components
  upgrade   Upgrade tc version
  version   display current tc version
```

:::note
- tc is an application composer meant for developers.
- No AI or LLM was ever used to write tc or generate this documentation.
- Currently tc supports only AWS serverless provider. Work is underway to support other cloud providers.
