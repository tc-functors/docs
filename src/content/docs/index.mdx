> tc is a **graph-based, executable architecture description language and framework** for cloud-native serverless systems, with entity abstraction, composition and infrastructure generation capabilities. tc (topology composer) provides a higher-level abstraction for serverless development, focusing on the logical relationships between abstract entities (functions, events, routes, queues, channels, mutations and pages) rather than the underlying infrastructure details.

<Card title="Unique Value Proposition">

	What makes tc genuinely different is the **graph-first, reletionship-first approach**. Every other tool still makes you think of infrastructure primitives (even if abstracted). tc says _"describe how things connect, we'll figure out the infrastructure."_

  The **fractal composition** and **namespace versioning** are also unique - tc lets you zoom into a sub-topology, create a sandbox, test it, then zoom back out to the full system while maintaining graph integrity.

	tc is unmatched when you have 30+ interconnected serverless components. You can see and understand the entire system topology at a glance becase relationships are explicit first-class citizens, not scattered implementation details.

<Card title="Aha! Moment">
	tc is unique because it asks a different question:
	<br/>

	**Terraform:** "What resources do you need?" <br/>
	**Serverless:** "What functions do you have?" <br/>
	**SST:** "What constructs compose your app?" <br/>
	**tc:** "What's the graph of your system?" <br/>

	<br/>
	tc is the *only infrastructure tool that thinks in graphs first*. Everything else is resource-first, function-first, or construct-first, then tries to add relationships. tc inverts this - **relationships are primary, implementation is derived**.

	The closest analogy: tc is to infrastructure what **React** was to UI - a fundamentally different mental model that elevates certain concerns (component relationships) above traditional concerns (DOM manipulation/infrastructure management)

</Card>

<Card title="Who is it for?">
    tc is for engineers building serverless systems **who value architecture clarity and team velocity** over fine-grained infrastructure control.

	It's targeting teams where *managing the complexity of component relationships* has become more painful than managing infrastructure itself.
