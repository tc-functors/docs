tc (topology composer) provides a higher-level abstraction for serverless development, focusing on the logical relationships between abstract entities (functions, events, routes, queues, channels, mutations and pages) rather than the underlying infrastructure details.

tc compiles a tree of entities defined in the filesystem as a topology. This composable, namespaced, sandboxed, recursive, versioned and isomorphic topology is called a `Cloud Functor`.

:::caution
tc is still quite nascent and is being actively developed. This documentation is work in progress.
