> “The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.” -  Edsger W. Dijkstra

tc (topology composer) provides a higher-level abstraction for serverless development, focusing on the logical relationships between abstract entities (functions, events, routes, queues, channels, mutations and pages) rather than the underlying infrastructure details.

tc compiles a tree of entities defined in the filesystem as a topology. This composable, namespaced, sandboxed, recursive, versioned and isomorphic topology is called a `Cloud Functor`.

:::caution
tc is still quite nascent and is being actively developed. This documentation is work in progress.
:::

tc is primarily a CLI app. There are external modules which provide a [HTMX-based Inspector UI](/extras/inspector/), a [Local Emulator](/extras/emulator/) and a [Lisp Interpreter](/extras/lisp).
The CLI app provides a core set of commands to manage the lifecycle of sandboxed topologies.

```
