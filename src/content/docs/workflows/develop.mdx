Following shows the stages or steps in developing, testing and debugging a topology using tc. Let's assume the name of the sandbox is `yoda` and the AWS_PROFILE (provider environment) is dev.


<Steps>

1. Scaffold

	```sh
	tc scaffold
	```

2. Compose

	```sh
	tc compose
	```

3. Create

	```sh
	tc create -s yoda -e dev
	```

4. Update

	```sh
	tc update -s yoda -e dev
	```
	or update specific components for faster iteration

	```sh
	tc update -s yoda -e dev -c ENTITY
	tc update -s yoda -e dev -c ENTITY/COMPONENT

	e.g
	tc update -s yoda -e dev -c routes
	tc update -s yoda -e dev -c functions/vars

	```
5. List

	```sh
	tc list -s yoda -e dev
	```

6. Invoke

	```sh
	tc invoke -s yoda -e dev -p payload.json
	tc invoke -s yoda -e dev -p s3://bucket/key.json
	```

7. Test


	```sh
	tc test -s yoda -e dev [--recursive]
	```

8. Delete


	```sh
	tc delete -s yoda -e dev [--recursive]
	```

</Steps>


## Scaffold

- Define your events, routes, channels, queues, pages in topology.yml
```yaml
routes:
  /api/foo:
    method: POST

events:
  MyEvent:
    producer: default

pages:
  myapp:
    dir: webapp
```

- Specify how they are connected. For example

```yaml
routes:
  /api/foo:
    method: POST
    authorizer: my-authorizer
    function: foo

events:
  MyEvent:
    producer: default
    function: bar

pages:
  myapp:
    dir: webapp
```

- Additional scaffold the functions if they don't exist, interactively.

```sh
tc scaffold --kind function
```

## Compose

We can now validate the entity definitions and their connections by running `tc compose`.
`tc compose` will generate a giant JSON that represents the target infrastructure (AWS Serverless by default).
You can see the generated permissions, target rules, mapping templates etc.

We can also have a tree view

```sh
tc compose -c functions -f tree
tc compose -s functions -f table
tc compose -c routes -f json
tc compose -c events -f json
tc compose -c states -f yaml
tc compose -c mutations -f graphql
```

:::note
We can also use the external tc-inspector UI to visualize and inspect the topology.

### Building Images

Most often, tc infers the kind of function, it's runtime and how to build it. However, we can override the kind of build, for example `Image` or `Inline`. See [Building Function Dependencies](/entities/functions#dependencies)

```sh
tc build
```

To build container images:

```
tc build --image base --publish
tc build --image code --publish
```

## Create Sandbox


The following command create a sandbox in the given AWS profile (-e|--profile)

```sh
cd <topology-dir>
tc create [--sandbox SANDBOX] [-e PROFILE]
```

## Update Sandbox

While developing, we often need to incrementally deploy certain components without recreating the entire topology. `tc` provides an update command that updates given entity and components.
An entity is a core composable servereless resource. . A component is an attribute or instance of the entity.


We can update an entity and/or component as follows:

```sh
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c Entity/Component

```

```sh
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c routes
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c events
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c functions
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c mutations
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c channels
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c schedules
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c queues
```

To update specific component in an entity:

Components in `function` entity:

```sh
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c functions/layers
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c functions/vars
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c functions/concurrency
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c functions/runtime
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c functions/tags
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c functions/roles
tc update -s sandnox -e PROFILE -c functions/function-name
```

Components in `mutation` entity:

```sh
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c mutations/authorizer
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c mutations/types
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c mutations/roles
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c mutations/RESOLVER_NAME
```

Components in `event` entity:

```sh
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c events/EVENT_NAME
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c events/roles
```

Components in `route` entity:

```sh
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c routes/ROUTE_NAME
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c routes/ROUTE_NAME/authorizer
tc update -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c routes/roles
```

## List sandbox

To list the entities in provisioned sandbox, do

```
tc list -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE [--format table|json]
tc list -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c ENTITY
```

## Invoke


### Payloads


By default, tc picks up a `payload.json` file in the current directory. You could optionally specify a payload file or an uri.

```
tc invoke -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE --payload payload.json
```

or via stdin
```
cat payload.json | tc invoke -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE
```

or as a param
```
tc invoke -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE --payload '{"data": "foo"}'
```

or as s3 URI:

```
tc invoke -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE --payload s3://bucket/key.json
```

### Invoke specific entities

:::note
tc invokes the root entity of the topology. It could be state (stepfunction), route or event. tc does a topological sort to identify the root entity.
:::

We can also invoke specify entity and/or component.

For example, to invoke a specific function in the topology:

```
tc invoke -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c functions/FUNCTION-NAME -p payload.json
```

To trigger/invoke a specific event. (Note the payload does not include detail-type or source of the event payload. It only has detail)

```
tc invoke -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE -c events/EVENT_NAME -p payload.json
```

## Delete Sandbox

To delete a sandbox:

```sh

tc delete -s sandbox -e env
```

To delete a specific entity/component. See update commands (above) for list of components

```
tc delete -s sandbox -e env -c ENTITY/COMPONENT
```

Optionally, you way want to prune stale resources in your sandbox. tc does not maintain an external state to keep track of stale resources (those you delete locally but not in your sandbox).

```sh
tc prune -s SANDBOX -e PROFILE [--filter regexp]
```

:::caution
It is not recommended to delete entities or components as it impacts the integrity of the sandbox.
