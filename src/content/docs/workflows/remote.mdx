Most tc commands can optionally run in a remote executor - typically your CI environment or a container in the cloud.

We can configure the executor to use in `config.executor.provider` [See Configuration].


<Steps>

1. Build

   We can use a `remote executor` to build heavy base images for functions with `Image` build kind. Make sure you commit and push your changes to the current branch. `tc` runs the build by checking out the branch on the remote executor.

   ```sh
   cd any-function-dir
   tc build --remote
   ```
   You could optionally sync those build images locally using `tc build --sync`. This is not required if your workflow is completely via remote executor.

   :::note
   Note `tc build --remote` is not recursive.

2. Create

   ```sh
   cd topology-or-function-dir
   tc create -s sandbox -e profile --remote
   ```

3. Update

   ```sh
   cd topology-or-function-dir
   tc update -s sandbox -e profile --remote
   ```
