The following flowchart and release workflow is perhaps opinionated. However, it is primarily to demonstrate how `tc` can be used at every stage in the development and release workflow, regardless of the CI/CD system that you may use.

### Opinionated QA Flow

<Steps>

1. PR Merge

	```sh
	tc tag --next patch
	```

2. Release to QA (bump Minor)

	```sh
	tc tag --next minor
	```

	Release step is optional.

3. Freeze

	```sh
	tc freeze -s stable -e qa
	```

	Freeze is a software-enforced freeze. Test! Test! Test! after freeze.

4. Snapshot

	```sh
	tc snapshot -s stable -e qa --save
	```

	This saves the snapshot of manifests, changelog and topology definitions to s3.

5. Unfreeze


	```sh
	tc unfreeze -s stable -e qa
	```
	This allows Continuous deploys to continue.

6. Promote

	To promote a snapshot, we first go back and pick the one that has been certified and tested in QA.
	For example:

	```sh
	tc snapshot --list
	qa/stable/2025-10-02
	qa/stable/2025-10-01
	qa/stable/2025-09-30
	qa/stable/2025-09-29
	qa/stable/2025-09-18
	```

	To deploy a snapshot (say qa/stable/2025-10-02), we do:

	```sh
	 tc ci-deploy --env prod --sandbox stable --snapshot qa/stable/2025-10-02
	```

	Behind the scenes, ci-deploy triggers a pipeline using the snapshot:

	```sh
   		tc snapshot --show qa/stable/2025-10-02 -f pipeline --target-env dev --target-sandbox stable
    ```


</Steps>
